    Before you begin this book, I need you to forget about the idea that reading is something easy, reading a book from start to finish is anything but easy. If when reading the words on the page you ever get a sense that your eyes and your body read the words but not your mind, maybe your mind went elsewhere, I need you to understand that’s very normal. Reading is a skill you practice. I read everyday and yet find it hard to pay attention, similar to meditating. But like a muscle, the more you train the ability to come back to an original point of focus, the better equipped your mind will be when you have to focus on school, work, or anything you need to accomplish in life. So use this opportunity to train your mind by reading this book, in exchange, I hope you learn something useful, if not that, at least be entertained, and if not even that, at least here you have one of countless tools for improving your attention span in this digitally dominated world of ours. 
    
    
    
    What i'm about to tell you is top secret. Have you ever felt like something was wrong with the world or perhaps maybe yourself? Something preventing you from reaching your full potential. Something that controls you, your family, your friends, your society. Have you ever wanted to break free? To be the one in control instead of being lost, to feel whole instead of empty, to be truly free instead of chained? The truth is, there is only one way to do this, a way I figured out for myself. I’ll give you a clue:
    
    I don’t give a shit about money

    Hello Friend. I will begin this book with possibly the two most fundamental questions of all philosphy ever written. What is the point of life? And what is the function of a human being? Actually, forget it, that’s too boring. Forget human beings, I want to know what is the point of YOUR life. What YOUR function is, you the person reading this.  
    
    The answer is simple: the point of life is to win challenges that progressively realize a worthy ideal, and your function is to love something greater than yourself.
    
    One last question. What does it mean to value anything? Simple. Value is created when pain is alleviated. If you want to make a ton of money, sacrifice your own pleasure in order to reduce other people’s pain and they will give you money. The more pain you alleviate, the more money they will pay you. 
    
    It’s 2024 as I write this, artificial intelligence has already taken over our world. Unfortunately for humanity, AI benefits from the laziness and lack of social interactions of its human users, the same way drug dealers benefit from the pain of their users and then sell them the temporary solution to their pain, anxiety, depression and loneliness. The COVID-19 pandemic was the perfect recipe for further pushing the development of all this technology as the consumption of these products were increased the less people spent time outside socializing and living with other people. Technology has become a thing that rewards individuals for loneliness and isolation, rewards them for lack of physical activity, rewards them for lack of impulse control, and rewards them for choosing immediate pleasures over long-term satisfaction. 
    
    The one thing they have in common is that they reward individuals for lacking willpower and discipline. Just like Fast-food, social media, Tobbaco, alcohol, explicit websites. They track your activities, find patterns, and try to manipulate people’s buying decisions. They invest billions of dollars to make sure you are under their control. This isn’t exactly that big of a deal when using these products as an adult, but when most children are practically given an iPad straight out the womb, it begs the question of whether future generations are being set for a life full of physical, mental and emotional instability that arises in many different shapes and forms. There is however, a generation somewhat in the middle. A generation who was in kindergarten by the time Nintendo was a global success. Maybe they were preteens when smartphones became a thing, before eventually evolving into teenagers spending most of their free time on YouTube, instagram and netflix, before eventually becoming college students addicted to TikTok. A lot have their own income that they can spend making GameStop go to the moon and cause significant impact on the US stock market. But almost all of the time spend a good amount of their day searching for memes, my personal favorite thing the internet has given us. Many have given this group of people a name: Gen Z. 
    
    
    
    College is an interesting time. Lots of parties, girls, drugs, sex. At least that’s what it seems if you base expectations off of movies and sitcoms. They tend to miss out on the boring lectures, the lack of money, the feelings of being lost. Most importantly the feeling of officially having the body of an adult while still feeling like they have the mind of a teenager . Takes a while for that feeling to go away. Don’t get me wrong, the stereotype I mentioned is not too far off, this is the age period where people still have raging hormones as teens, lack complete frontal lobe maturation and the ability to control impulses and emotions, and also coincidentally the time in your life you are the most “free” of true responsibility. Going to school is only hard if you make it hard for yourself. Again don’t get me wrong, you should be making it hard for yourself. Your supposed to be training your discipline, you should be going to class ESPECIALLY when you don’t feel like it. You should study ESPECIALLY when you don’t feel like it. You should pay attention ESPECIALLY when your bored. Because that’s essentially what life is: long term goals that requires sacrificing short term pleasures. The fastest way to INSTANTLY increase your discipline at least somewhat is by being painfully and consciously aware of your own mortality. Young people don’t understand what older people do, which is that everyone without exception, as long as your not killed by a person, animal, or object, dies of illness. High school shouldn’t be about memorizing, but about educating and training the mind to think clearly and logically in order to maximize physical AND MENTAL health. If you look at medecine in general there are tons and tons of progress being made. In general, the more time goes on the better we get at treating stuff like heart disease, organ transplants, etc, but the realm of Psychiatry is the one place where things are collectively getting worse and worse. College and university are not only about education, it is about training the ability to delay gratification, increasing the size of your anterior cingulate cortex in your frontal lobes, and by consequence, increasing one’s maturity through mental challenge and struggle. If you hate school then that might actually be a good sign believe it or not. If school is too easy then the graduates are all stupid and lazy (cough cough America). Thus school should teach the ability that is arguably the most useful in order to be successful in any endeavour, doing hard work ESPECIALLY when you DON’T feel like it. 
    
    There's a region of the brain that we are only recently beginning to understand. It lies in our frontal lobes and is called the Anterior Cingulate Cortex. This brain area has an insane amount of different functions, for example it’s a hub that contains a large amount of dopamine D1 receptors, as well as plenty of Noradrenaline receptors, but the most important is that it’s the part of us that enables us to endure suffering for a worthy cause as well as generate the will to live and get up in the morning everyday. Now these might seem like two separate functions but not really. People might think that life is beautiful and then when something bad happens it causes you pain, but no. Pain, anxiety, depression and loneliness are the default, we spend all our lives essentially trying to feel comfortable, safe and loved. But the world is tough so we need a way to deal with discomfort, uncertainty and solitude. The problem is, if you turn off this brain region, you turn off your awareness of pain as well your ability to deal with it. That is essentially what technology does when used for entertainment, it’s also exactly what alcohol and cLunabis does, so do video games. We temporarily don’t feel our ego, our life problems are pushed outside of our awareness and we feel momentary reward and satisfaction. The fact that this comes from a mobile device we keep in our pockets at all times can prove to be quite the obstacle when trying to study in university. 
    
     But sitting in class, doing homework, that’s not much different than the life of a 10 year old. The difference of course is now in college the coursework is harder, but more than that, you now are not simply the receiver of the benefits of a structured society, you now become one of the necessary builders that we all become, this is a skill not many are taught in elementary and high school, explaining why many smart kids do bad in college, why average kids do better because they were forced to learn disciplined study habits. Because teenagers who misunderstand the real world can sometimes believe this huge lie. A lie that has been propagated much in American culture. 
    
    That lie is the idea that your supposed to live your life doing what YOU want, what makes YOU happy, what makes YOU fulfilled. What an absolute fucking delusional way of viewing reality. Unless your planning to be a hermit farming your own plants, hunting your own animals, and taking responsibility for EVERYTHING in your life, you need to depend on others and outsource the tremendous responsibility that is your existence. In turn, that means other people are gonna depend on you. So life is not about being an individual intellect inside of your brain that lives only to make oneself feel whole, but rather an incomplete piece of an enormous network of social connections that works to serve the whole of humanity. 
    
    You are an element in a network. You are connected to everything in this universe, but more so other human beings. That means you should live your life in alliance to those that matter to you. You should serve as many people as possible, and thus increasing the amount of people that serve you. How do you know who matters? You already know the answer: love. Not romantic love, but trust, loyalty and commitment, the love that is most powerful in a family but can extend as fair as our imagination. Human beings have an enormous amount of oxytocin receptors. We are made to be connected, to serve, to love, to cherish, to grieve, to fight, to miss, and most importantly to suffer. The easiest way to avoid pain is to never let yourself love anything, but if that’s the way you wLuna live, please kill yourself. 
    
    I’m serious, I’m not joking. If you wLuna live a life where you don’t love anyone or anything, get off this earth right now, ask ChatGPT the easier method to off yourself instead of wasting the precious time and resources given to you by God. You are absolutely useless and God (no I don’t mean judeo-christian god or allah) doesn’t want you. He created you to love, he created everything to love, I know that’s a very complicated thing to understand, how things like rocks and water are made to love, but by the end of this book you will truly understand where it all comes from. How an atom, a star, a human, DNA, dark matter, it’s all in the relationship of love and hate, life and death. Existence and non-existence. God lets you decide, are you gonna be a human being worthy of life, the choice is yours. But don’t believe the lie that everyone deserves life. Almost everyone. As long as you are able to love, you are worthy of forgiveness, life and happiness. I don’t care who you are, what mistakes you made, what flaws you were born with, as long as you love someone in this life, there is no sin that cannot be forgiven. And the time period that a lot of us commit many sins, is in our young adult life, full of hormones and emotions, lacking in discipline. But that is also how people learn. 
    
    The thing is, I’ve heard a lot about coming of age stories, about kids that become teenagers, about teenagers in high school growing up and shit. But I don’t see many stories about that age period after high school, where your an adult, but don’t feel like an adult. Like you were given the keys to a very expensive car without knowing how to drive, your told that this is the only car you’ll ever have, and now you have places you need to go and you just gotta learn to drive as you go. But driving isn’t nearly as hard to learn as being an adult. Adulting in this metaphor is more like piloting a super complicated airplane, and this leads us to the beginning of this story.
    
    
    
    On June 28th, 2021, an Airbus 330-200 was descending its flight towards the country of Burundi, located in Central East Africa. There lies the beginning of our story. It was a plane operated by KLM, a Dutch airline whose journey was originating from Amsterdam. It had been about a year since the President of Burundi’s death, a death that didn’t necessarily bring much sadness to many, as happens when a corrupt political leader that creates an election where your forced to vote for the one party. Needles to say, the country was currently filled with massive ongoing political instability. It was also the middle of a global pandemic. A pandemic that was terribly, TERRIBLY controlled by the Quebec government. The whole global issue made it so people were reluctant to travel, so the plane seats were mostly empty. At the back of the plane was a teenager. He had dreadlocks with a skin fade on his head. His name was Elijah, born and raised in Montreal, Quebec. He was on his way to a funeral. His mother and father had both died of the same unknown disease. They went to all the doctors they could possibly find to no avail, it appeared to be some form of autoimmune disease. They both died on the day of his 18th birthday, as if God wanted to create the biggest challenge for him, desperately needing to grow up quickly, but he was having trouble overcoming the many bad habits that had developed as a result of living in the comfort of parental guidance. Elijah was having a problem though. None of it felt real. It hadn’t hit him yet. He hadn’t been living with his parents for about a year, so his daily routine was unaltered, but he felt a deep painful dark ‘grayness’ and emptiness about reality. He grew up a spoiled kid thinking it was all about having fun, but now he was reminded that no matter how disciplined or motivated you are, everyone either gets sick or dies. One day it would be his turn, and he had no idea how he would deal with it. The best solution his mind came up with to soothe his negative emotions is to simply not think about. At this point it was around 2:30pm local time in Burundi when the pilot announced they would begin the landing process. 
    
    However, in the middle of him speaking the announcement, there seemed to be sounds of a strange frequency being emitted from the speaker. It was ringing some high frequency sound that was unbearable to Elijah’s ears. It seemed that no one around him could feel this. Usually when we are in a plane and the plane begins its descent, the difference in air pressure causes a little blockage in our ears that is quite normal. People around him were assuming he was having an unusual reaction to this phenomena. However, it wasn’t the air pressure that was bothering him, it was the airplane speaker. About 20 seconds later, as if a wave had just hit everyone on the plane at once, everyone felt this high frequency vibration sound and all instantly began to start screaming in pain. Babies crying, passengers getting out of their seat despite the turbulence and seat belt sign still being on. As Elijah opens his eyes he sees something weird, four guys seem unaffected. All of them looked Burundian, one with a short messy looking afro and a purple hoodie, one with twists that separated in the middle and went on each side, one with long locks that were tied with a headband, and the other with a short low taper fade. Then Elijah looks out the window and sees something inexplicable. The sky had turned completely dark. The Sun was out a mere couple of seconds ago, it was the middle of the day! Instead of having the African landscape under them, it seemed like nothing but a void where space seemed like it was getting distorted. Then the plane begins falling incredibly fast. Our main character passes out in all the confusion…
    
    
    
    He later wakes up to the heat of the sun tapping on his forehead and all over his skin. He feels too weak to open his eyes for now. His muscles all feel sore for some reason. He finally opens his eyes to realize he was sitting in his plane seat 21D, however, this plane seat was suspended in vines on top of a jungle. Beneath were a couple of feet before reaching the ground. Had it not been for the vines he would have fallen and possibly been injured, or dead. He slowly climbs out of the seat and gently makes his way down and lands safely. Judging from the state of things. He looks around and finds himself in the middle of a huge jungle, extremely confused. He comes to the conclusion that the plane must have crashed and that the weird visions of the sun disappearing he saw may have been from the lack of oxygen or something. He begins laughing, this was too cliche. He had seen this countless times in stories, films and media. A story about someone that survives a plane crash and has to live on this new island they found themselves. After laughing for maybe a minute two, all joy leaves his face and instead is replaced by a look of worried and confused terror. The problem was, this wasn’t a movie, this was really happening to him. 
    
    
    
    After resting for a bit, he decides staying in one place won’t do him any good, so he begins wandering around. After walking through the jungle a bit, he began to get hungry and instantly realized that expending all this energy was a bad idea. He had no idea how long he could go like this. He looked around, all he could see were leaves, no real signs of fruit, no nuts, nothing he could safely identify as edible and eat. There also didn’t seem to be signs of water anywhere. He decides to stop walking. His heart, his mind, his stomach is filled with nothing but absolute negativity. The jungle seemed pretty at first, full of nature and a warm comfortable air. Eventually the leaves turned from the color green to gray. The warm air became unbearable cold, despite the temperature not changing. His body felt like it all of a sudden couldn’t support the weight of the earth’s gravity.  His legs felt wobbly. His stomach felt like the anxiousness you feel on a roller coaster approaching its peak, constantly getting closer and closer without ever reaching the top. He gently lets himself fall to the floor, curling up in a fetal position. There was nothing he could do. Nothing positive to go towards, Nothing to protect him from danger, and yet this is where he felt like he had to be most alert. But he couldn’t. His inner monologue started chattering incessantly trying to find some kind of solution. His overthinking turned his inner monologue into a dialogue of optimism and pessimism, with the optimistic side losing 100% of the arguments. The dialogue turned into chatter with the voice splitting from one, to two, to many, all sprouting negativity. His mind, which was supposed to be his greatest asset as a human being, seemed to turn against him. The sun was still high in the sky suggesting it might have been around noon, the timing of which felt off to him but he knew at some point, the night was coming. Paranoia begins to settle in. Despite the lack of immediate threat, the possibility of threat lied in any place he found himself. Danger was no one place, danger was wherever he currently was, danger was on the inside of him. An animal would be focused on solving the immediate problem of hunger, pain and safety, but instead of seeing one potential source of danger, the human mind has a way of living in an abstract reality filled with a multitude of potential dangers. An abstract reality that could prevent us from being blinded to one problem, and thus we gain the ability to predict and foresee multiple potential dangers at once without having to use our limited bodies. He sat there imagining what he would do if he couldn’t find water, what if he can’t find food? What if there are predators? What if he’s found by people who don’t speak his language and now he’s held captive. Ironically, the more and more his mind attempted to predict the future, the weaker the accuracy of each prediction. The more emotional he became, the weaker the accuracy. Despite his need to conserve energy, his heart is beating incredibly fast, his breath is taking more oxygen than he needs, and fails to expel out the toxic carbon dioxide, his thoughts have had their brakes removed, he felt like he was crashing. 
    
    All of a sudden he hears an animal walking behind him. It was a pig. A filthy ugly pig. He began looking at this animal in a new way. Full of hate, envy and jealousy. How was it that he was out here suffering in the jungle unable to do anything for himself, and yet this disgusting foul-smelling pig, without a thought in the world, without intelligence, without awareness seemed happy, he seemed full, he seemed satisfied just eating the leaves he found on the ground. Was it possible that mankind’s awareness and intelligence were actually detrimental rather than helpful?
    
     The answer is no. God has given humans the ability of enhanced awareness, enabling us the potential for both great good and great evil. People often argue, “if god is all powerful, why doesn’t he destroy evil?” The answer is because he loves us. To destroy evil is to destroy humanity. Only humanity has the ability for evil, thus, by definition only humanity has the ability for good. This is because of the laws of Daiosm, yin/yang, Isaac newtons law, Karma, different version of the same truth that for something to exist it’s opposite must also exist. People think evil only exists because good exists, but it’s the opposite. When humanity hadn’t evolved yet and lived in the paradise of the jungle, that is when right and wrong did not exist. Only the strong ones survived, only the social ones reproduced, only the ones capable of giving up their individuality were able to have healthy offsprings. 
    
    People search for individual purpose in life, it’s all bullshit. Human beings have but one purpose: to raise healthy, safe and happy future generations, in that order that is all. 
    
    Now to be precise, this doesn’t mean everyone has the same purpose of getting married having two kids living in a house with a dog like the stupid american dream designed to breed nothing but future generations that will consume. The reason this has worked so well however, is because the theoretical american dream hits the last two points very well, but might have missed the first step. 
    
    First of all, to raise future generations doesn’t require everyone to be parents. In fact, human society have become the most advanced as soon as we began specializing our skills. Instead of having individual parents mLunage parenting, and their child’s education, it’s better to have one member of a tribe, typically an older member, be specifically in charge of acquiring as much information as possible and educating many children together in a group. The desire to forage for useful information and disperse it to a group of individuals is an instinct many people develop even at a young age. It stems from curiosity and breeds passion. That passion then leads to a rewarding effect of learning useful information that is useful to oneself AND others, because human beings are hyper social. That way, an individual parent doesn’t require the ability to know everything. The same goes for making food, for creating shelter, for hunting, for making clothes, for building tools. If you’re a good parent, you already have a purpose, if you’re a plumber, a businessman, a teacher, an architect, an artist, an engineer, a doctor, a cashier, literally whatever, as long as the work you do, one way or another, improves the world for present or future generations, you have already found your purpose. Teenagers often feel lost, which is good. Teenagers and young adults are not supposed to feel confident and safe. They should be driven by a fear of being inadequate, that is what makes people grow. Even if your job is as a soldier deciding to kill members of the enemy, by saving your own children, your own nation's future, you have a purpose, whether it’s a good or bad purpose is different altogether. Purpose cannot be given to oneself for oneself. It is always about the future. Always about children. And that is why humans are the most anxious animals, but that anxiety is what enables us to be the most successful, but not by itself. There is another aspect of the human mind even more important: hope.
    
    You see, your brain, the thing your using to read these words, have something called frontal lobes. The frontal lobes are exactly that that enables humans to plan for such a long term future. The truth is, you have two brains behind your forehead, one in your right hemisphere and one in your left and both roles differ very very slightly. Your right brain is designed to search for future potential sources of negative emotions, the left brain is designed to search for future potential sources of positive emotions. Our brains are literally designed in a yin and yang format. Fun fact: people who have anxiety, OCD and social anxiety tend to have hyperactive right frontal lobes, this is because their minds are constantly thinking that something bad is gonna happen soon, constantly preparing for some abstract danger. People with depression, ADHD and substance abuse disorders tend to have hyperactive left frontal lobes, this is because their minds are constantly looking for happiness, novel stimuli, for stimulation, for rewards, for pleasure, for positive emotion. Most people in general have balanced brains that communicate and work together in coordination. But no one is really perfect, so many people can have similar symptoms to these disorders. You can even Lunalyze yourself and think about your own behaviours, see if your more of a left brained or right brained person. Which kind of person you are, is mostly genetic unfortunately, although it is true that when a part of the brain is used more often, it grows. So people who are addicted perform a behaviour, and feel good, which motivates them to try and feel even better, but then with every repetition of the behavior, that muscle in their brain that pulls them towards more and more powerful positive stimuli grows, brain regions designed to give this system a break shrink. People who are anxious can be stressed, and then be afraid of being stressed, and then become anxious about being afraid of being stressed and having a panic attack in front of people and embarrassing their entire bloodline and family and humiliating themselves for every and ever and potentially dying! You see how that escalated too quickly? Whether or not the abstract desire or fear is realistic, the emotion felt is always true. That is why there is nothing more true to an individual than their emotions, but when it comes to a group there is nothing more true than actions. 
    
    
    But most animals don’t need all this. The reason we do is because human babies are incredibly weak. Thus the adult has to do all the thinking and preparation for the near two decade period it takes for a human to transform from a baby to fully developed adult. This is not the same for most animals, including the pig standing in front of Elijah. 
    
    This pig was fat, he had tons of stored energy, all from leaves, but Elijah would starve eating leaves. All of the emotions in his mind had run out. Except for one, the one fundamental animalistic emotion that almost doesn’t even require consciousness to experience: pure, unadulterated and focused… RAGE. His dopamine and noradrenaline levels had never been so high in his life. The left part of his brain craved the pleasure of eating food, the right part of his brain was terrified of the pain of starvation. It was all clear, he knew what he needed to do. Right in front of him. Only one thing would make him feel whole. No thought process or planning, pure instinct, he knew he had to steal. He had to steal this pig’s energy. He had to kill it, with no weapons, no energy, barehanded. 
    
    And thus he begins to chase the pig. He realizes this pig is more like a boar because it had incredible speed. He ran and ran and ran, he almost catches up to it, and then trips and falls on his head. He passes out. 
    
    He wakes up in pain. He spoke no words. He understood what had happened. He failed. He lost. The pig won. This lowly creature was now superior to him. The plants, the animals, the insects, the fish, they all had the ability to survive in the wild. He didn’t. This meant he was officially the weakest creature in the entire jungle. He was at the complete bottom of the food chain. Unable to do anything but sit there and wait for his imminent death. 
    
    And then he hears an external voice that shut all the other internal ones up. This one wasn’t his imagination. He looks behind him and doesn’t see anything other than leaves and branches. He hears it again. It was a voice that sounded like Japanese, whispering. He then steps on a branch and hears a scream. He looks, the branch that looked like a sword was the thing that was talking. It was repeating the same words. 
    
    Kaizen, kaizen, kaizen, kaizen, kaizen, kaizen, kaizen …
    
    
    Elijah: Hello??
    
    ???: Kaizen, kaizen, kaizen
    
    Elijah tries to explain he needs it to speak english. The sword then stops repeating the same words and begins repeating after Elijah. Any word that Elijah would say this branch seemed to speak and repeat back to him. Eventually the stick shuts up. Elijah tries to break the stick and realizes the branch is unbelievably sturdy for some reason. Elijah tries breaking it multiple ways and realizes something. Everytime he attempts to destroy it, it becomes harder and harder to do, not because he himself is getting weaker, but somehow the stick actually gets stronger the more he uses it. It even slightly grew in length and width. Realizing this was not an ordinary stick, he decides to keep this with him. He walks around and begins talking to the stick despite not hearing any answers. He figured that if he was alone on this island without human contact, he still needed a way to organize his thoughts and plan his own behaviors, he felt weird about talking out loud when no one was there, hoping he didn’t seem crazy, but this entire experience was crazy so he didn’t mind. 
    
    A couple of hours of exploring later, it started to become night time. He climbs a tree successfully and finds a little spot where he can lay down in a tolerable but not comfortable manner. He tries to sleep but finds it impossible. He had no idea if this place was inhabited by potential predators, in the shape of large animals or small insects. He also still did not have any plan for how he was gonna get out of this. He lays down on that branch with his eyes open, his body very still trying to conserve energy as much as possible, with his stomach aching from hunger and knees and feet sore from all the walking around. He did not get more than an hour of sleep. He spent about 9 hours on that branch still, resting his body in a way but his mind had no time to recover. One thing he was able to appreciate during this miserable situation was the sky. The stars were abundant in a way he had never seen before. The sky seemed so different in a way he could not describe. He had never in his life seen a view of the stars this clearly void of any interference from artificial light. He realizes how small he is compared to the scale of the observable universe. He was raised with christian parents, he never truly believed in God but he didn’t believe God was dead either. When he saw the pure complexity of the physics, the chemistry and the biology that made up his world, it’s hard to believe that it was all coincidentally unintentional. He figured maybe everything was for a reason, a reason more important than him. In this jungle his worldview changed from atheist to agnostic, however, it was only out of the necessity to find some reason to stay alive. The thought had entered his mind. Why was dying even a bad thing? In the real world outside of society, he believed there was no such thing as good or evil. Everything simply was, and it was us humans that attributed value to things. He believed that there were only four things in this world: people, tools, obstacles and irrelevant objects. Much of his life he had wondered about his purpose, his reason for being alive, but he had never been in a situation where he had to question whether being alive was possible, not just if it was worth it. But after looking at the beauty of the stars, he realized they weren’t particularly useful, and yet they were beautiful, valuable even. Maybe he himself didn’t need to have a reason to exist, maybe his value was innate? He had no idea. But This thought was the only one so far that had been able to put a slight ease on his current state of depression and anxiety. Maybe it wasn’t up to him to plan everything. Maybe all he had to do was follow the path that was given to him. He had found a stick that somehow mLunaged to speak words. With this supernatural phenomena, he was forced to put on hold everything he currently believed and forced to view the world through an open mind. 
    
    As he wakes up in the morning, he hears a scream. It sounded like it came from a woman. He couldn’t believe he hadn’t thought about it, what if there were other survivors? He then decides to run off in search of the source of that scream.

    The pursuit of a positive emotion is itself a negative emotion, but the acceptance of a negative emotion is itself a positive emotion -Alan watts
    
    
    Elijah, fueled by a new sense of purpose, follows the distant cries in search of another survivor. The dense vegetation makes progress slow and challenging, but the persistent echoes guide him through the unfamiliar terrain. As he pushes through the jungle, the vibrant sounds of exotic birds and the rustling of leaves become a symphony, weaving together a tapestry of nature's melody.
    
    After what feels like an eternity, Elijah stumbles upon a clearing where he discovers a young woman. She appears to be in her early twenties, with long, wavy hair and a mix of confusion and relief in her eyes. She's clad in torn clothing, evidence of the ordeal she, too, must have faced. In front of her was a snake that seemed like it was about to eat it’s prey before averting it’s gaze at Elijah. The snake littered and almost got Elijah’s last but then Elijah killed it using the stick he found. The interesting thing is that his reflexes activated automatically with incredible speed such that he felt like the sword killed the snake of its own accord.
    
    
    
     As Elijah approaches cautiously, the woman looks at him with a mix of surprise and gratitude.
    
    Elijah: (speaking slowly) "Hey, are you okay? My name is Elijah. I was on that plane too."
    
    Woman: (with a fluent but Brazilian accent) "Elijah? Oh my gosh, I thought I was alone here! I'm Luna. What happened? Where are we?"
    
    Elijah: "I'm not entirely sure. The plane crashed, and I woke up here in the jungle. Do you remember anything strange during the descent?"
    
    Luna: "Yes, there was this weird sound, like a high-pitched frequency. Then everything went dark, and the next thing I knew, I was here. Do you have any idea where we are? Are we in Burundi?”
    
    Elijah: "I think so but I have No clue. And there's something even stranger. I found this branch, and it seems... well, alive. It repeats what I say and even gets stronger when I try to break it."
    
    Luna: (looking intrigued) "That's bizarre. Maybe it has some connection to this place. Anyway, we should focus on surviving. Have you found any food or water?"
    
    Elijah shakes his head, realizing the urgency of their situation. He’s impressed by how calm and goal oriented she seemed. He wishes he had behaved like that the first day instead of throwing himself a pity party. The two decide to explore the surrounding area together, hoping to find sustenance. The jungle, though beautiful, presents numerous challenges. After a while, their stomachs growl in protest, hunger becoming a persistent companion.
    
    Luna: "We need to find something to eat, Elijah. I didn’t eat anything on that plane. I can't go on like this."
    
    Elijah: (Holy shit, as hungry as I am she must be feeling even worse than me. Not to mention I have more fat and muscle to survive off of in times of scarcity. She seems fit and athletic but still way too lean.) "Agreed. Let's look for berries or any fruits we can identify."
    
    What surprised Elijah about all this was how quickly she, but also himself, adapted to their situation. Many people would have been panicking or worrying, although he did already go through that phase. Maybe she had gone through that phase as well before he arrived, she did seem like she was crying. Was he supposed to be her savior?
    
    
    
    While exploring further, they stumble upon a peculiar-looking mushroom. Luna, with a hint of caution, recalls a basic knowledge of identifying edible mushrooms.
    
    Luna: "I think I remember something about mushrooms like these being safe to eat. "
    
    Elijah: “What if it’s not? The chances of randomly eating a poisonous mushroom is much higher than the chance of finding one that just so happens to fit into what our human digestive system allows, not to mention what our immune system is designed to fight against. 
    
    Luna: “I know but I have a feeling these mushrooms are made for us, like it’s the universe trying to give us a chance for survival.” 
    
    Elijah: (That is absolutely ridiculous. There is no way she is unaware of these dangers. But I see where she is coming from, we are both incredibly hungry. Her hunger might be overriding her decision making.) “Fine. We can eat the mushrooms if you can find me even one shred of logical proof that they are safe.” 
    
    Luna: “Proof? How am I supposed to logically convince you in this wild jungle when you were the one explaining to me about your stick that seems to talk to you. Doesn’t seem very logical does it?”
    
    Elijah: (sighs) “I guess you're right. “ 
    
    Luna: But I get where you are coming from. Being hungry is better than being dead. Let’s try and find something else first. 
    
    
    The jungle seemed endless, and despite their best efforts, Luna and Elijah found no berries or edible fruits. The initial relief from finding the mushrooms had faded, and their hunger returned with a vengeance. Exhausted and desperate, they decide to revisit the peculiar mushrooms they had found earlier. The lack of alternatives left them with little choice but to try the mysterious fungi.
    
    Luna: "Well, it's now or never. If we don't find something else soon, we might not have another chance. Let's give it a shot."
    
    Elijah nods in agreement, and they carefully prepare the mushrooms, hoping that their instincts and Elijah's limited knowledge on mushrooms are enough to keep them safe. Surprisingly, the mushrooms tasted better than expected, offering a savory flavor that hinted at a hidden richness within.
    
    Time passes, and to their relief, they experience no adverse effects. In fact, the mushrooms seem to provide a sense of satisfaction, alleviating their immediate hunger.
    
    Luna: “Gracas a Deus. I was so afraid to eat those, but it looks like we lucked out. They're not only safe but actually quite tasty."
    
    Elijah: "Yeah, it's strange. I thought they might be a risky choice, but they seem fine. Maybe we've stumbled upon some kind of natural food source here, guess I was right to trust you."
    
    Elijah and Luna decide to gather more of the mushrooms, creating a makeshift meal. The two share a moment of gratitude for finding sustenance in the midst of the jungle's challenges.
    
    As Luna was eating the mushrooms you could see her face absolutely filled with joy and happiness. Elijah couldn’t relate. He envied her ability to feel happy in this situation, but his mind was elsewhere. While Luna was sitting here in the present moment, Elijah’s mind was traveling light speed in two directions, the past and the future. He tried recalling every moment of his past that led up to this moment, trying to find explLunations, but the more he realized he was completely lost the more hopeless and depressed he felt. So his mind changed direction and went to the future, although that was even worse. He had no idea how these two would survive. Mushrooms have a tiny small amount of protein, not a bad source of certain B vitamins and certain minerals, but they were extremely low in calories. It seemed like despite Luna being hungrier than him she seemed to be full more easily. Luna noticed this and ended up letting him eat more than her. He asked her if she was sure about this. She was. She never throughout her whole life had a big appetite. She said she hated being indebted to him for finding her. She said she wanted them to be equal. And so he accepted, eating approximately 1.5/2 times as much as her.
    
    After about 2 hours of sitting down and resting. Something begins to change. Luna starts becoming very grateful to him and to every plant around her. Almost overly grateful to the point of annoyance. Then he realized her eyes looked different. 
    
    Luna: (slurring her words): whens your birthday
    
    Elijah: December 25th
    
    Luna: whaaaaat ahahahaha no way your lying to me
    
        Elijah: I swear on my momma
    
        Luna: Mine is January 6th.
    
    Luna: Um Elijah
    
    Elijah: yess (uh oh)
    
    Luna: I think I just remembered why I recognized those mushrooms.
    
    Elijah: oh for fucks sake 
    
    
    Elijah realizes exactly what had happened, but the odds of this happening were so slim he hadn’t though of it. He was worried about the mushrooms being poisonous, never did he wonder if they would be hallucinogenic, which he realizes was kinda stupid on his part. The problem was, he had consumed almost twice what she did and a few minutes later he began to feel something in his mind, his body, his sensory processing change. 
    
    Under the enchanting influence of the mysterious psilocybin mushrooms, Elijah and Luna found themselves transcending the boundaries of ordinary perception. The jungle around them became a kaleidoscope of pulsating colors, and the air resonated with an ethereal energy that seemed to bind everything together.
    
    Luna's consciousness expanded into a state of interconnectedness. The patterns in the leaves, the dance of light and shadow, and the rustle of the breeze all coalesced into a unified symphony. Her sense of self dissolved, and she felt like a tiny, harmonious fragment of the grand tapestry of existence. She finds a weird pattern in the dirt. Something seemed unnatural, though she couldn’t see it she could feel it. She dug under the earth and she found a radiating green emerald. 
    
    
    
    Luna: “I was right!!!!”
    
    Elijah: woahh that’s a nice gem. Right about what
    
    Luna: Everything in this world, is absolutely perfect. The only things we could ever find wrong in this world are man-made. But in this world free of the oppression of the patriarchy, mother nature is beautiful. Look at this jungle, the trees, the leaves, the branches, the roots, the dirt, the grass, the water, the insects, it’s all connected. It all originated from the same place. (She begins speaking very fast with huge open eyes like a maniac) Have you ever heard about Pando? It’s an entire forest that is really only one tree, but the roots go deep into the ground and cover an enormous surface area. It's incredible! I feel like all of reality is like this. I don't feel like 'me' anymore. I'm part of everything, just a tiny spark in the cosmic dance. And if everything is all One, then we must have all originally come from the same place, is that place God? Elijah are you hearing this? Elijah???
    
    
    His eyes were completely locked and immobile, mouth wide open staring at his wooden stick, Kaizen, who radiated a celestial glow, and its melodic voice began speaking. He put the stick to his ears, closed his eyes and listened carefully. She on the other hand took the emerald with her and would keep it by her side. She had a sense that this emerald would become something of great importance in the near future.
    
    Elijah: “What are you trying to say?? Speak louder and clearly. I need words not sounds.”
    
    Luna looks at him strangely.
    
    Luna: “Who are you talking to??”
    
    Elijah: “ You don’t hear these whispers coming out of the sword? You don’t see the radiating light eminating from it??” 
    
    Luna: No it looks like an ordinary stick to me and i dont hear anything. But have you been listening to what I’ve been saying?? Don’t you see all these new colors in the jungle??
    
    Elijah: I don’t. In fact, everything other than Kaizen is dark and grey. The only color I see is … I guess red. 
    
    Luna decided to stay in her own world. She suddenly felt like her body was levitating. A euphoric numbness was spreading throughout her body that made her feel the need to lay on the ground flat on her back and closing her eyes. Trying to be at one with nature. She felt like the earth was spinning, which was funny because the earth was spinning! This thought made her laugh. She thought of a tv show she used to watch, there was a character named toph. Luna could identify with her. She could suddenly feel seven energy centers in her body dancing around in pure balance. As if everything in this world was perfect, just the way it should be. 
    
    
    
    Elijah: Wait I think he’s saying something. 
    
    
    Kaizen: In the beginning, nothing. In an instance everything. But before the beginning, was the end.
    
    
    
    
    At this point, Elijah began having visions. He saw a huge tree of epic portions and next to it was a man in robes with a long wooden stick.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    He later snapped to reality. He looked up in the sky, it seemed like all the stars in the sky were falling, falling towards him. As if the earth truly lay in the center of the universe. Then all the light entered inside him and he felt wonderful. Then it all came back out like the Big Bang and he felt empty and hopeless. It happened over and over again in waves of feeling good and feeling bad, for what felt like an hour, but in real time, only 6 minutes had passed. 
    
    Finally he came to this blackness. He couldn’t see anything, he had no spatial awareness. All he could do was think. But when he quieted his mind of verbal thoughts he could understand someone explaining something to him, in Kaizen’s voice.
    
    Kaizen: 1st Law: Nothing is created from nothing. In order to gain something, something of equal value must be given up. All Positives require negatives. And all negatives require positives. For darkness to exist, light is required. For evil to exist, good is required. For life to exist, death is required. 
    
    Kaizen: Elijah. You have been entrusted with the sword that guards the way to the life-giving tree. A sword made from an element beyond our world, an element of anti-fragility, that grows stronger the more damage it endures, thus retaining the same properties as your mind. I repeat, your mind grows stronger the more pain it endures. Elijah. The world will begin sending you messages, it is your responsibility to recognize and understand these code words being transmitted to you and only you, no one else. You must understand the different missions being sent to you. Nothing matters, except your eternal quest for the truth. There is a fight coming. A battle that can only be fought by man. But you are not meant to do it alone. You need a partner. And that is why I brought you here. Do not tell anyone about this or else you and everything you love will be punished. Doing so would disrupt the flow of time and space across all the heavens and the earth. 
    
    He then woke up in a weird place. As if he was dreaming. You know how dreams are. You don’t exactly remember the visual details of the environment, you only remember the visual of the whats happening. He saw Luna dressed like a princess smiling at him, behind her was the moon. But there was something about her. He could tell she was only pretending to be happy, as if she was hiding deep pain and sadness behind those eyes. He recognized that in this image of her. He felt like he wanted to save her, but for some reason in the dream, it was like he had something bigger to focus on, as if this image in front of him was a distraction, or a test. 
    
    He turned around and saw a man. This man was wearing a black hoodie over his head, with ripped blue jeans, a gucci belt, a pair of blue airforces, and a black covid mask covering his mouth. All that could be seen in his face were his eyes, he had large bug eyes like Elliot Alderson from the show Mr Robot, with huge bags under his eyes, his face looked like he hadn’t slept in days. He was dark skinned yet looked pale for his complexion. Elijah could smell something, it smelled like marijuana, the hooded man lit up a joint in his mouth, inhaled, exhaled and then spoke.
    
    ???: Never interfere with the Mastermind’s plan. Father Time conquers all. 
    
     He then pointed a glocked and placed it right between Elijahs eyebrows, fired and all of a sudden Elijah woke back up to the present moment. 
    
    Elijah felt a surge of self-awareness, a calling that made him acutely conscious of his individuality. He believed he alone was special, entrusted with a profound responsibility to save the world from an impending disaster and yet had no idea where the threat would come from or what he should do to prepare. Throughout all this he recognized the absurdity of these revelations, but his perceptions and emotions were so intense that he just could not dismiss any of this as being “not real”. 
    
    But he had no idea what to make of the second vision. Who was the mastermind??
    
    Elijah: "Luna, I've been chosen. Kaizen says I have a mission, a duty to prevent a great catastrophe. I need to save the world. It's all on me. Oh god, now that the words came out my mouth I realize I’m not okay. I need a minute, I just need sleep. My mind is like a speed train, so many thoughts in my head. It's too fast, it's too much, it’s like electricity in my brain. Arghhh make it stop. "
    
    Luna, in her egoless state, did not really register anything Elijah said. Her mind was free of mental chatter. In contrast, Elijah grappled with the weight of a perceived destiny, feeling the burden of a singular responsibility.
    
    Luna: Do you have a favorite number??? Mine is the number 3. The holy trinity. The power of a trio. There's a profound elegance in the simplicity of threes - a beginning, a middle, and an end. the id, the ego, the superego. The mother, father and child. The three stages of life, birth, life and death. So what's your favorite number?
    
    Elijah: Uhh I guess, 5? I like the number 5. 
    
    Luna: Woah Elijah Do you know what this means????
    
    Elijah: whatttt
    
    Luna: i have five fingers. You have five fingers. 5 + 5 = 10. Oh my god. When we count numbers we go from zero to 9. Those are ten numbers, ten digits, ten fingers, maybe you are chosen!!?!?
    
    Elijah: Obviously humans created the decimal system inspired by the counting we use with our fingers. That’s why computers use binary coz they dont need the extra digits. 
    
    Luna: You know what you just don’t get it. Anyways Elijah, take off your shirt.
    
    Elijah: What?? Are you high?? Why would I do that??? (he takes it off)
    
    Luna: Woahhhh.
    
    Elijah: What do you see?
    
    Luna: I can see your chakras.
    
    Elijah: wow you really are high
    
    Luna: No I swear, in hinduism, the 4th chakra is the heart chakra usually vibrating a green color. I can see your other chakras. Your root chakra seems binary, either all at once or nothing at all, your crown chakra seems like it only just recently gained tremendous power (must have to do with your vision I guess?), your third eye is very weak, your throat overactive, your solar plexus is neutral, and your sacral chakra is also weak, but really it's the green aura emanating from your heart that is absolutely mind blowing powerful!!
    
    Elijah: (As crazy and irrational as everything she's telling me is, I can’t act like my experience was any better)
    
    Luna: Have you ever been in love? I think that’s what all human beings need to be happy. Not necessarily romance. But just love in general. Loving your family, friends, teachers, coworkers, neighbors, strangers, even your enemies. I thought I’d be happy if I was rich, but all the money I’ve saved up for is no good here.
    
    Elijah: Love? … that’s not what human beings need to be happy, well not for me at least.
    
    Luna: Then what makes you happy?
    
    Elijah: … Winning. I’ve been a loser all my life. I tried playing sports. I was too uncoordinated to play hockey, I can’t aim when i kick a soccer ball, I have butterfingers when I play football,  I can’t control dribbling when I play basketball. I try at school, but everything bores me, I can’t focus and fail most my classes, especially math, I suck at math. I can’t make any friends for some reason because everyone likes to tease me and then I get angry and they end up hating me. I try getting girls, but I can never read their cues, I neve know what they want. I try to be nice, but i guess girls like tall strong muscular bad boys, I’m just a pussy. I’m unathletic, can’t fight, stupid, have no bitches, and im broke. People love me out of obligation, but all I want in life is to get to a point where I finally stop being a loser, but I’m not sure that’s possibly.
    
    Luna looked at him. She was paying attention listening to every word. Part of her felt sympathy, but most of her felt disgust. She had a feeling a lot of this guys' issues were sort of his own fault for having such a shitty mindset. But she resisted the urge to judge him too quickly, though she judged him quite accurately.
    
    Luna: That’s not very rational tho is it?
    
    Elijah: What do you mean? It's very rational. It’s binary, I’m either a winner or a loser. 
    
    Luna: So what about me, do you see me as a winner or a loser?
    
    Elijah: I don’t know about other people. I view everyone as equal.
    
    Luna: And yet you say you're a loser. 
    
    Elijah: Yeah.
    
    Luna: You don’t really take good care of yourself, do you back home?
    
    Elijah: How did you know? I mean … what makes you say that?
    
    Luna: Just a feeling. Just try being grateful for once. Do you have family and friends?
    
    Elijah: … Yeah I have a nice family. I was raised alright. I have like 4-5 online friends, we text on snap but never meet in real life, especially with this COVID thing I haven’t been able to see anyone. Just me and my own thoughts all the time. I was supposed to reinvent myself in college, but I’m just the same, if anything I’m worse because I’m the same but time moves on. Anyways enough about me I was talking about my friends, they’re nice to me. Not a huge amount, but we’ve known each other a long time I think we’re tight. 
    
    Luna: see I just told you to be grateful and you managed to start talking about yourself. We’ll here’s an example. You see what happened when you saved me. I was grateful to you. 
    
    Elijah: Yeah if you had saved me I would feel the same.
    
    Luna: You know gratitude doesn’t need to come from other people. It can begin from you to you.
    
    Elijah: (Kaizen’s first law echoed in his mind.) Nothing can be created from nothing. 
    
    
    Luna began to back off and give him space. She got up. She looked at the jungle around them.
    
    Luna: …
    
    Luna: you can put your shirt back on you know. I hope you didn’t expect me to ask for more ahaha.
    
    Elijah: (I would’ve taken off my pants if you asked me) I would’ve taken off my pants if you asked me
    
    Luna: What!!!!!
    
    
    Elijah: Wait, wait. No I didn’t mean to say that. Something’s happened to me since I took those mushrooms. 
    
    
    
    Elijah: Ask me a question that's embarrassing but not disgusting. 
    
    Luna: Uhh. What's your greatest fear? 
    
    He waited for about two whole minutes. He finally said…
    
    Elijah: The cold…
    
    Luna: What the cold?
    
    Elijah: The cold feeling of isolation and loneliness. 
    
    Luna: …
    
    Elijah: This confirms it.
    
    Luna: What?
    
    He starts staring at his hands.
    
    Elijah: I’ve lost the ability to lie.
    
    Luna: Seriously?
    
    Elijah: Those mushrooms, that vision, this sword, my mission. Nothing is created from nothing. In order to gain something, something of equal value must be given up, that’s what Kaizen told me in my vision. 
    
    Luna: So in exchange for gaining this sword you lost the ability to lie?
    
    Elijah: Your smart you catch on quickly, yeah pretty much. I think? So many questions so little answers. 
    
    Luna: … well that’ll definitely make it easy to be your friend. You might be a little blunt and you are kind of a loser by the way you speak and think, but at least I know I can trust you this way. (Not to mention I doubt this guy is stronger than me)
    
    Elijah: About the loser thing I was thinking. Maybe, just maybe, in this place, in this world, I don’t have to be a loser. If I do everything right, by the time I get back home the pandemic will be over. This means I’ve got some time to myself where I can grow, I can focus, I can grind, but most importantly I can start over. Train my body, train my mind. If I focus on improving myself then maybe I can be the winner of this jungle. 
    
    Luna (as if anyone or anything cares about being the winner of the jungle. Jeez this guy is so self-centered). You know improving yourself isn’t always about transforming yourself into a winner. I mean who are you even comparing yourself to? Who is your competition?
    
    Elijah: I guess, idk other men?
    
    Luna: What kind of men? Guys you see on social media? I have to admit even here I do miss going on tiktok and instagram. Trying out new dances and finding funny memes, people can hate on it or find it cringe but it’s honestly so much fun and the memes are always so creative. But as a girl it’s too easy for me to see all these pretty girls on tiktok or Instagram and compare myself to them. I guess I see where your coming from. Don’t worry most of it is fake you know.
    
    Elijah: You got no idea where I’m coming from. I don’t go on tiktok for dances, maybe sometimes for memes. I prefer YouTube where I can get advice from high performing high value men. Those are the guys I compare myself to. Guys that are disciplined i guess, the type that do what they say they’ll do all the time. The guys that are able to workout in the morning, the guys that can keep themselves and their room clean, the guys that girls find attractive, the guys that eat healthy and plan long-term the guys that are intelligent and read, the guys that make a lot of money. 
    
    Luna: See right there, you’ve just proven my point, you’ve just compared yourself to five different people with different skill sets. Not all guys who workout make a lot of money, not all guys who are rich are healthy or get girls. You see what I mean? I’ve been on somewhat of a self-improvement journey myself you know, but the progress isn’t linear. Back home I’m studying Economics. I grew up poor my whole life, so I understand the value of money. I decided to treat myself like a company and take stock of myself, but a stock’s trajectory isn’t linear you know, it goes up and down. That’s how the self improvement journey goes. Some days you win, some days you lose, but I watched a video on youtube where this guy was saying compare yourself to who you were yesterday not to who someone else is today. But with consistency, sometimes stock prices grow exponentially, with a value of despair where you put a lot of work in but the results just aren’t there yet and thats when people quit, that’s how progress works too, so it’s normal if you don’t feel progress right away. The funny part is when you look at companies on the nasdaq, you only see the value of the company after it’s been registered legally and all the initial work is done. This mean when you see a stock price, you don’t see the pain and misery that went into the beginning stages of that startup. You just graduated high school man. You were used to being top grade in your school to being officially part of the youngest generation of adults that exist right now. It’s normal to feel like your low-status and insecure.
    
    
    But you, Elijah. With your mindset I’m guaranteed you’ll never accomplish anything in your life. I’m sure you have goals, or problems, or things about yourself or the world around you that bothers you that you wish you could fix, you probably could, if you just stopped giving up all the time and acting like a grown baby boy.
    
    Elijah (how did she get all that about me? Things ive never told her, is it really that obvious in the vibe I give off)
    
    Elijah: But… I couldn’t even defeat a filthy pig. That piece of scum beat me. I’m worse than scum. Everywhere I go I’m still such a loser. Just a lowly filthy loser that can’t do anything. Maybe I deserve to be in pain-
    
    Luna: Oh for fucks sake SHUT UP. SHUT THE FUCK UP YOU GODAMN PUSSY!!! I get it. Get  over it already jeez. Life is hard and it always sucks, always. Everyone's life is hard, it’s always hard, it’s always painful.  you’re starting to piss me off. If you hate that pig so much, be a man and go hunt.
    
    She slapped him hard on the back. That sent a jolt of electricity down his spine. After the hit he grunted, then stood still for a moment staring at the ground, his breathing slowly started getting faster. His exhaustion temporarily disappeared in an instant, along with the negativity. His eyes opened up, He began to see color again, he began smiling, and then laughing hard like a maniac.
    
    
    
    Elijah: You're right. You're right. YOU’RE RIGHT!!!. 
    
    Luna (startled): right about what.
    
    Elijah: IN THIS WORLD I DON'T HAVE TO PRETEND. I CAN ACT THE TRUTH. I'M NOT AN ADULT. I WILL NEVER BE AN ADULT. BUT I WILL ALWAYS BE …
    
    Elijah: A MAN!!!!!!!!!!!!

    He sped off completely forgetting about Luna. 
    
    Luna: WAIT WHERE ARE YOU GOING
    
    Elijah: TO BRING BACK SOME MEATTTTTTT!
    
    He sped off…
    
    Luna: Ugh… what an idiot … what does it even mean to be a man? So irrational. What happened to real men? Like my uncle, not like my father. It’s like … when humanity lived in the wild like this, women had painful childbirth so men had to endure the pain of work to make it even. But jeez nowadays men act like teenagers. They’re all so arrogant, they think the world is built for them (I guess it kinda is), they think they know everything. They’re all so fucking spoiled. No wonder I’ve never had a serious boyfriend. I thought I was being too picky, but it’s like high testosterone is such a rarity these days. 
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    After about an hour Elijah comes back to the spot where he left. He had kaizen in his hands the whole time, he never left its side. He finds Luna sitting down in the same spot he had left her. 
    
    Luna: Are you kidding me I had no idea if you were coming back? More importantly did you find anything?
    
    Elijah arrives out of breath, slumps on the ground before saying
    
    Elijah: I found nothing. I used up all this energy for absolutely nothing. 
    
    Luna slapped him in the face
    
    Elijah: what is wrong with you
    
    Luna: YOUR TELLING ME AFTER ALL THE RISK THERE'S NO REWARD???
    
    Elijah: first of all what risk second of all I like running it’s own reward
    
    Luna: WHAT ABOUT ME?
    
    Elijah: I would’ve given you half of the meat I brought back, don't worry.
    
    Luna: Ugh men are so stupid. Why were you running? If you just waited two seconds we could have gone out and walked together. Would have been safer, less energy consuming, and increase our chances of finding something.
    
    Elijah: yeah well… We don’t have all the time in the world. It’s getting dark. We gotta find something to eat and a place to sleep.
    
    Luna: Agreed
    
    They both decide to walk, they weren’t exactly sure what they were in search of.
    
    Luna: Hey can I ask you for a favor. 
    
    Elijah: Yeah sure. 
    
    Luna: Your parents are from Burundi right?
    
    Elijah: Yup both, I’m a pure blood. 
    
    Luna: I see. My mother is burundian. My father is from Cuba but I’m born in Brazil.
    
    Elijah: Haha so your only half black? (Jeez was that supposed to be funny? Why am i so cringe. Am I cringe? Maybe I’m fine. Gosh I’m overthinking what did she even say. What were we talking about again? Ugh my thoughts are sideways. Okay just act like a normal human would act during a convo, but how would a human act? I don’t even know how a human acts??? WHATS WRONG WIT ME, )
    
    Luna: I don’t really know my father. 
    
    Elijah: Uhh Well you look black. Anyways what was that favor you wanted.
    
    Luna: Since we both have burundian blood, lets just pretend that we’re cousins. That cool with you?
    
    Elijah instantly felt something funny in his stomach. By funny I mean he actually found it humorous, yet somehow offensive. In his mind he thought he kind of understood where she was coming from. He thought that from her perspective she was alone in the jungle with a man. Elijah assumed that she must be intimidated by him (she wasn’t, in fact she looked down on him). He figured she wanted to avoid the pain of romance and heartbreak and it would be easier if they had more of a brother sister relationship. Although he didn’t like the idea of an attractive woman outside his family treating him like a brother or a cousin, he also wasn’t exactly interested in romance in a setting where his main focus is survival. The reality of Luna’s feelings was completely different to the idea Elijah made in his head. 
    
    Elijah: Agreed I wouldn’t want any romance distracting me.
    
    Luna: ???? PFFFFF AHAHHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHHA. Who said anything about romance? Is this because of your inability to lie??
    
    It wasn’t. He wasn’t able to lie anymore but he still had the ability to omit the truth. He just had this bad habit of saying the first thoughts that entered his mind. Now he was incredibly embarrassed and this was a social situation he couldn’t just escape from like with his virtual friends. This meant he was now forced to learn new skills. 
    
    Elijah: Nevermind
    
    Luna: Let me clarify, I say that because I don’t want us to be strangers who are only bound by circumstances. I think whether we like each other or not, we don’t have a choice but to cooperate, I know you might feel like you’ll get slowed down by a girl like me, but i'm no girl, i'm a woman. I can probably run faster than you, not to mention you've never been in a real fight before. 
    
    Elijah: huh How do you know all this about me just by looking at me??
    
    Luna: well your Canadian
    
    Elijah: WHAT DOES THAT MEAN 
    
    Luna: AHAHAHA I can tell.. You people are all so nice and polite, and I bet you grew up your whole life in a safe town. I’m from brazil, you might think fighting is for boys but it's especially us girls that are forced to learn how to defend ourselves, I’m sure I don’t need to explain why.
    
    Elijah: I-I-I I mean your not wrong about me, but don’t generalize canadians like that. canadians aint as nice as you think, we’re just educated and quite wealthy. It’s like Japan a little, when you live in a safe place people become polite, but I feel like media confused canadians niceness with being feminine or being a pushover. Anyways whatever i don’t even care about all that. so youve been in a fight before?
    
    She stopped walking suddenly. And then starts again
    
    Luna: only once, all that matters is I won, all thanks to my uncle teaching me karate and jiu-jitsu ever since the age of three. Anyways, if you could change anything about the world what would it be?
    
    Elijah: (what a quick change of subject but okay) uhhh I don’t know, what about you.
    
    She stops again. 
    
    
    Luna: If I could change anything about the world, it would be dismantling this oppressive patriarchal capitalist system that governs our lives. I mean, look at us, walking through the jungle, surviving, and yet, lots of animals are still bound by the same societal structures that have perpetuated inequality and injustice for centuries.
    
    Elijah looks at Luna, slightly taken aback by the sudden intensity of her monologue. He had no idea what she meant by the last part about the patriarchy opressing animals. The ridiculousness of it almost made him laugh.
    
    Luna: You see, this system is designed to keep certain people in power while others suffer. It's not just about gender; it's about race, class, and every intersection in between. I hate how it forces us into predefined roles and expectations. Women are expected to be nurturing and submissive, yet we can’t afford to be weak. High school is a nightmare, full of shame. We can’t be too fat without being judged, we can’t be too skinny without being judged. We can’t be too loud, can’t be too quiet. If we’re ambitious and career driven, we’re attempting to succeed in a masculine dominated environment. If we want to stay home and take care of kids, we have to pay insane amounts of money for daycare, making us depend on money. We all depend on money, both guys and girls, but who creates this money, at the end of the day it’s a bunch of old rich men in banks. They used to have slaves who they gave a place to live in exchange for a life of servitude and work, but then what happened, when slavery was abolished, they instead paid workers just enough money so they could have a place to sleep and eat, and nothing more. And then there's the economic aspect, where the rich get richer, and the poor struggle just to survive. So it’s not only women that suffer. Even young boys are pressured to conform to this toxic idea of masculinity. Just look at Andrew Tate poisoning the youth with his ideas of toxic masculinity.
    
    Elijah smirks: Poisoning the youth by teaching young men to stop being depressed and start going to the gym, making money and improving themselves?
    
    Luna: Are you serious??? Have you not seen the influence he's had on young boys?? All the misogynistic shit this guys have been saying.
    
    Elijah: Name one negative thing he’s said about women.
    
    Luna: Do you live under a rock or something?
    
    Elijah: Let’s assume I do. I don’t but let's assume I do, name one bad thing he’s said. 
    
    Luna: ….
    
    Elijah: I can even help you, remember that one video where he said that the world would be a better place if women had their body counts on their foreheads? 
    
    Luna: Yes exactly thats absolutely ridiculous. 
    
    Elijah: Well if that were true then women would be more careful with who they sleep with. They wouldn’t want that number to go up. Although that's pretty much what most of human history was like, people wouldn’t sleep around because they didn’t want rumors spread about them having sex before marriage and risking STDs and childbirth, until contraception. Once men and women discovered the ability to have sex without reproduction or getting stds, every one started whoring around. Now look at society. Who would want to have kids when you have all the pleasure of sex with none of the pain. So We have less kids, isn’t that great? Until you realize the only way to add good to the world is by raising and educating children properly. I believe there are two genders, males and females. Females are responsible for creating good in the world, and men are responsible for fighting evil (or in the modern world we call solve problems), when girls start sleeping around however they want, they start acting like men. And then they are able to work, so they genuinely don’t need men, which is great for the women, but as a consequence men don’t need to be as masculine and end up acting like women. So now we’re all raised by people who are just in the middle, neither embracing their masculinity nor their femininity. As a result, neither of us have role models, neither men nor women. So you look at teenagers nowadays, the guys have no role models teaching them how to be a good man, and the woman don’t have role models teaching them to be good women. I can’t generalize so I aint saying this is a rule. I might be wrong, in fact im like 90% sure im wrong, but …that’s what I’ve observed, nah more like thats how i feel. 
    
    Luna: … Tell me something. Do you hate women?
    
    Elijah: … It’s not that I love women, (he then turns around to look at her and smiles) It’s that I literally don’t love anything other than women. ( ughh. Again with my cringey ass)
    
    Luna felt confusion. She was looking at a self-proclaimed loser. He seemed self centered, arrogant, stupid even. Yet in that moment, she realized that despite all that, this might be the first time she met a guy who was so … genuine. She still kept her initial feeling of rage and utter disgust towards him, as if she wasn’t looking at boy, but definitely not a man, not even a teenager, not even a guy, he had this enthusiasm about him that for some reason came with a dark depressing self centered arrogant energy in his mind. His heart seemed pure, it seemed to be his mind that was the problem, she made a connection to the third eye which he hadn’t yet activated. She had somehow skipped the journey of unlocking hers through that spiritual journey, but it seems that for Elijah this only made things more difficult for him. She realized she was stuck with him, so making an enemy of him wouldn’t help. But as they walked in silence after that moment, she realized, Elijah was wrong about a lot of things, but that last part, the part about men acting like women, women like men and everyone in the middle making there less role models, she had never thought of it. In Brazil where she’s from, the opposite was true, guys often joined gangs, and were all so full of testosterone, in the poor neighborhood she lived in, lots of single mothers had to fully embrace their feminine side and take care of children by themselves. But she had instagram, she watched a lot of netflix, laughing at the ridiculousness of western american society, she didn’t agree with him, but she had an open mind to see where he was coming from. She knew one thing was for sure, this guy grew up privileged.
    
    Elijah: also you mentioned it’s about gender class and race. As if all men benefit from the patriarchy, but who you think built the patriarchy? Surely wasn’t me, wasn’t my father, wasn’t my uncles, wasn’t my ancestors, nah the patriarchy your talking about is like this sorta system that was taken over by rich old white people. You know what? At the end of the day it’s all their fkn fault. Even the land we’re standing on was colonized by old rich german and belgian white men, the place im from canada by english and french men, and the land your from by portuguese i guess? Idk the history of brazil. Even the soldiers that came in physically, they’re following orders, so maybe they’re not to blame, but it’s really the old wealthy crackers making these decisions. Julius caeser, Alexander the Great, fuck even Jesus Christ is painted as a white man despite probably being more middle eastern. You search up hairstyles on google, it’s all white, America, literally built on stolen slaves. Canadian all live on stolen land from the natives. It’s all bullshit. How can someone be proud to be Canadian? Proud to be American? Proud to be European? Proud to be white? It sickens me. If we just lived in a world without white people imagine how peaceful the world would be.
    
    Luna: Jeez. I didn’t take you for someone so racist. Let me guess you're from a white dominant neighborhood and got bullied for your skin color?
    
    Elijah: (how tf is SHE SO DAMN GOOD AT READING) you really think I’m the racist one? I’m not saying we should kill all white people and cause genocide, its too late were stuck with them now. But black people are literally the original perfect form of human beings. You said it yourself, for us, everything in this world is perfect. But Caucasians are just all one big pile of genetically mutated freaks. Can you imagine waking up everyday, having beige skin, having skin that turns red, turns blue, its fucking ridiculous. All these white kids in my high school thinking they know what it’s like to be black. Confusing the idea of the african american male portrayed in media with all black men. So many of them listen to hip hop and all of a sudden they start to pretend they know our culture, and then when I do something like be interested in anime, be interested in hollywood culture, in video games, or even be interested in science, philosophy or literature, they say I act white
    
    Luna: One last question about what we were talking about before
    
    Elijah: whats with all these questions
    
    Luna: in the spirit of opening up and getting to know each other. What would you say is your biggest fear…
    
    Elijah: You already asked me that question.
    
    Luna: surely there must be something worse. If i’m really opening up, my greatest fear I have is having my body taken advantage of. I won’t go into details of my history but I think enough has been said. You said loneliness but surely that can’t be the worse…
    
    Elijah: Nothing is worse to me. I don’t mind physical pain. But just to clarify, I don’t mean being alone or solitude; I actually love being alone and having my own space. What I’m talking about is that depression, that gnawing, sinking, dreadful sense of isolation, where you could be surrounded by a hundred people, yet still feel utterly alone. It's a different kind of emptiness, a void that consumes you from the inside.
    
    Luna glanced at Elijah, sensing the weight behind his words.
    
    Luna: I get it. It's like a darkness that clouds everything, even in the brightest moments. Loneliness is a silent, invisible struggle that no one else can fully grasp.
    
    Elijah: Exactly. Physical pain, injuries, they heal over time. But that emotional pain, that feeling of disconnection from the world, it's relentless. It erodes at your soul, and you start questioning your own existence.
    
    Luna nodded, a shared understanding passing between them. The jungle, with its dense foliage and mysterious sounds, seemed to echo the complexity of their emotions.
    
    Luna: (softly) Loneliness can turn the most vibrant colors into shades of gray. It's like being trapped in a never-ending storm, searching for a way out but unable to find shelter.
    
    Elijah: (nodding) And the worst part is, sometimes it feels like you're the only one going through it. That isolation within yourself makes it all the more unbearable.
    
    Luna: You know there’s a saying of eating the antidote before the poison. I’ve felt like that before plenty of times, but my mother and my uncle have taught me the solution.
    
    Elijah: whatever it is im sure its not that simple, but tell me
    
    Luna: Its gratitude.
    
    Elijah (again same old answer ive heard so many times): how does that work? 
    
    Luna: hehe im sure you can figure it out yourself. But I promise it’s the secret to everything you’ll ever want out of life.
    
    Elijah: jeez what a tease. Anyways, its pretty much nightime now. And we still haven’t…
    
    
    All of a sudden Elijah jumps. He looks up. Luna looks up, all of a sudden they noticed there was a poorly built treehouse up high in the trees of the jungle. It was definitely man made, there was a door, even a sort of ladder
